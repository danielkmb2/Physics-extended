#Unity rigidbody improvements

This project contains a list of corrections over the unity3d's stock physics engine.

Current tools:
-------
- Unstable rotation model. Uses the inertia tensor of the object to model an acurate unbalanced rotation.
- Simple Magnus effect model. Only for spherical objects by now.
